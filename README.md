The Mystery Number
 
 
1.  Game: Mystery Number 
Make a program that allows the user to guess a number between 1 and 10 chosen by the computer at random 
by indicating at each proposition (read with the prompt function) if the number to guess is bigger or smaller 
than the proposition. When the number is found, you will display the "score", i.e. the number of attempts 
necessary to arrive at the solution. 
 
2.  Hall of Fame 
We are now going to manage a "Hall of Fame" storing the 10 best results (in number of attempts 
necessary to reach the solution) obtained by the players during the same session. To do this you will 
declare an array of 10 objects to store the names of the 10 best players with their score expressed in 
number of attempts. When a player finds a solution, we indicate, in addition to the number of attempts, his 
When a player finds a solution, we indicate his rank if he is in the 10 best players and we ask him for his name to enter it in the array of strings. 
You can use the methods of adding and sorting the array objects in Javascript. 
 
3.  Time 
Add to the previous exercise the calculation of the number of seconds elapsed between the beginning of the game (activation by a 
GO" button) and the discovery of the number by the user. You will display this number at the same time as the 
number of attempts. You will use the "Date" object for this. You will store this information in the 
Hall of Fame" players
